Home
 Home is the landing page of the website. Once users enter the url to the address bar, 
 this is the page that they will be redirected to. Home is the brochure of the site. 
 It talks about the drone, and the technologies that were used to create it. At this 
 point we do not have any further information about the page, other than the fact that
 it talks about the drone

About Us
Is the biographical site, talks about the team, and the process that each member went
through blah. Each team member has photo and a teaser text, that when clicked on, redirects
to the main biography.

How To
Kenny is the best because he provided what we want to talk about. The how to page will be 
a one page step by step process on how to build the Arduino drone advertised on the websites.
Any references to apis, repositories, will be on this page.

Download Links
The Download Links page is basically a tile based span 3/3/3, type downloads location, to where 
each tile will have a download option available when clicked. There will also be a picture that
previews the code or file.
